/*
 * Weights:
 *
 * - TZDU messages (TranZoom Dimension Update) messages carry more weight than
 *   others.
 * - For Roles, non null foreign key attributes means more information from
 *   associated Entities as well: more weight than others.
 * - id and name are important properties: more weight than others.
 *
 * Type 2 hash:
 *
 * - Less attributes than the weight calculation are used to calculate the type
 *   2 hash, most notably not part of the hash are:
 *
 *   - the external id field. id's are pointers to objects, but not part of the
 *     intrinsic properties of the real world objects themselves. Entity
 *     resolution of objects that have overlapping id's will result in a merge
 *     of the id field.
 *   - foreign key attributes like player, scoper. Though a change in playing
 *     entity or scoping organiztion would be a large change, the references to
 *     internal _id values are bound to change in future entity resolution
 *     updates. Also it is unlikely that the actual refered real world object
 *     of these references would change, as by definition a reference to a new
 *     scoper implies that a new role exists.
